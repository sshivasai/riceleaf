## Problem Statement            * To develop a CNN Model for detection of diseases caused to the Rice Leaf          * MultiClass Classification (3 Classes)


# Rice Leaf Disease using CNN

#### The dataset contains images of rice leaf. 
#### There are three classes/diseases: 
            * Bacterial leaf blight 
            * Brown spot and 
            * Leaf smut 
    Each having 40 images. The format of all images are jpg.

#### What is leaf blight disease?

        Leaf blight disease is caused by the fungus Helminthosporium turcicum Pass. The disease develops on sorghum leaves particularly under humid conditions by producing reddish-purple or tan spots that coalesce to form large lesions. It attacks seedlings as well as older plants.

#### How to identify leaf Blight ?

        * Water-soaked to yellowish stripes on leaf blades or starting at leaf tips with a wavy margin
        * Leaves with undulated yellowish white or golden yellow marginal necrosis, drying of leaves back from tip and       curling, leaving mid rib intact are the major symptoms.
        
#### What is Brown Spot ?
            Brown spot is a fungal disease that infects the coleoptile, leaves, leaf sheath, panicle branches, glumes, and spikelets. Its most observable damage is the numerous big spots on the leaves which can kill the whole leaf. When infection occurs in the seed, unfilled grains or spotted or discolored seeds are formed.
            
#### How to identify Brown Spot ?
           * Bacterial leaf spot diseases often start as small dark brown to black spots with a halo of yellow tissue        surrounding each spot.
           * In some cases, the center of the leaf spot will dry up and fall out, giving the leaf a "shot hole" appearance.
           
#### What is Leaf Smut ?
            Leaf smut, caused by the fungus Entyloma oryzae, is a widely distributed, but somewhat minor, disease of rice.
            
#### How to identify Leaf Smut ?
            Many spots can be found on the same leaf, but the spots remain distinct from each other. Typical symptoms of     leaf smut breaks open when wet and releases the black spores. Heavily infected leaves turn yellow, and the leaf tips die and turn gray
